# sqlite-cache-for-google-sheets

This is one of those highly opinionated libraries that either works for you or it doesn't. I think I've designed a pretty clean API. It works for my use case which is to rapidly develop apps or data science scripts on top of data that myself or others have stored in Google Sheets. It fails the simple building blocks rule and I know it; it's a complex piece that might be too specialized to one person's uses cases. If you suspect it won't work for your use case, it probably won't.

Using the second (1th) data point to infer type is hacky.
